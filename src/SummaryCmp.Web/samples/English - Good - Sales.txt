Business deal with specific company and product names
Hi John! It's me, Will, your colleague from Sales. I'm calling you because the client I've been working with - you know, the big one? Called "Enterprise Solutions LTD"? They finally agreed to have a deal with us. This is actually great news! They're planning to buy the biggest plan, "Pro Max", too. The one thing they still want to know if we can send them reports customized with their logo. Please call me back when you're free.
