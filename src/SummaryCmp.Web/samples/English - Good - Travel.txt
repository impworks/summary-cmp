Hi John! It's your wife, Samantha. Do you remember how we've wanted to have a vacation in Italy? I think I just found a perfect opportunity for that. The "Air Italy" has a flash sale of really cheap tickets. One costs 99 EUR per person, it's direct, takes 2 hours, but it's departing at 03:15 AM. I know you are not a fan of night flights, but it's so cheap! Wait... What? I'm busy, do it yourself! Yes, you're a grown up boy, you can get yourself a glass of water. Sorry, it's the kids again! Driving me nuts. What was I about? Ah yes, and the other one's a bit more expensive: 138 EUR, starts at 12:20 but it has a connection in Frankfurt, so takes a little over 6 hours. So what do you think?
