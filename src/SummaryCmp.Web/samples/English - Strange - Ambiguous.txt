Inconclusive and conflicting facts
Hi, it's Tom. I wanted to confirm our meeting next week - I think, we said Tuesday at 2 PM? Or wait, was it Wednesday? I am looking at my calendar and I actually have a conflict on Tuesday afternoon. Could we do Wednesday morning instead, maybe at 10 AM? Actually, you know what, let me check with the rest of the team first and I'll send you an email with a few options. Talk soon!
