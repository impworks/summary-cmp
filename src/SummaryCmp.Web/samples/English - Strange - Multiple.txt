Hi John, this is Jennifer from the sales team. So, I just got off the phone with "Enterprise Solutions LTD" and they're ready to sign the renewal, but they want to add 5 more licenses. Can you send me the updated pricing? Oh, and also, I need to reschedule our pipeline review meeting from Thursday to Friday because I have a conflict. And one more thing - did you ever get an answer from Finance about whether we can expense client dinners over 200 EUR? I submitted one last week and it's still pending. Okay, let me know about all that when you get a chance. Thanks!
